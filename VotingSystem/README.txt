Here's a step-by-step guide on setting up the database:
 - Ensure you have the Derby Client Driver version 10.16.1.1 or version 10.14.2.0.
 - In Apache Netbeans, go to the "Services" tab, right-click "Java DB".
   Select "Properties". Change "Database location" to the location of "VotingSystemDatabase".
 - You may be prompted to enter username and password. Username: administrator, Password: admin.

DATABASE ERRORS:
We have noted that, sometimes on school PCs specifically, you may experience trouble connecting to the database.

SOLUTION:
Create a new database named "VotingSystemDatabase". Set Username: administrator, Password: admin.
No need to create a table, we have made provision within our code for issues such as this.
However, you may need to add vehicles to the database.

How To Run Our Program:
1. Run "VotingSystemServer".
2. Run "VotingSystem".

NB: The order in which you run the program is very important.
